Code Implementation
The code is implemented in Python and consists of class definitions for each of the components mentioned above. Below are the key classes and their functionalities:

CASE IST OR TASK IST 

[[

User Class:
* Methods to create and view orders.


Product Class:
* Method to update stock when products are added to an order.


Order Class:
* Methods to add products and process payments.


OrderProduct Class:
* Holds the relationship between orders and products.


Payment Class:
* Processes payments and updates payment status.


Example Usage
An example usage is provided in the code, demonstrating how to create a user, add a product, create an order, and process a payment.

How to Run the Code
Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. The code is compatible with Python 3.x.

Setup:
Copy the provided code into a Python file, e.g., ecommerce.py.


Execution:

* Run the script from the command line:
(bash)

Verify

*  Open In Editor
*  python ecommerce.py
*  Output:

The console will display messages indicating the status of payment processing and any other relevant information based on the example usage.

TASK 2 :

[[

a  Define the System Requirements
--> Identify the key components:
* Products (items in stock)
* Stock levels (current quantity of each product)
* Restocking thresholds (minimum quantity to trigger restocking)
* Restocking quantities (amount to order when restocking)
* Suppliers (providers of products)
* Determine the system's functionality:
* Track stock levels in real-time
* Alert when stock levels reach restocking thresholds
* Automate restocking orders to suppliers
* Provide reporting and analytics on stock levels and restocking history

--> Design the System Architecture
* Choose a suitable programming language and framework:
* Python with Flask or Django for a web-based application
* Java with Spring Boot for a more robust enterprise solution
* Design the database schema:
* Products table: product_id, name, description, unit_price
* Stock table: stock_id, product_id, quantity, restocking_threshold, restocking_quantity
* Suppliers table: supplier_id, name, contact_info
* Orders table: order_id, supplier_id, product_id, quantity, order_date
* Plan the system's workflow:
* User interface for tracking stock levels and managing restocking
* Automated tasks for checking stock levels and sending restocking alerts
* Integration with suppliers for automated ordering

-->Implement the System
= Create the database and tables:
* Use SQL to create the database schema
* Populate the tables with initial data


--> Develop the user interface:
* Create a web-based interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript


--> Implement features for tracking stock levels and managing restocking
= Implement automated tasks:
* Use a scheduling library (e.g., Celery, Quartz) to run tasks periodically


--> Write tasks to check stock levels and send restocking alerts
= Integrate with suppliers:
* Use APIs or EDI to integrate with suppliers' systems
* Implement automated ordering and tracking of orders


--> Test and Deploy the System
= Test the system thoroughly:
* Unit testing and integration testing


--> Test the user interface and automated tasks
= Deploy the system:
* Deploy to a production environment (e.g., cloud, on-premises)
* Configure monitoring and logging


--> Maintain and Improve the System
= Monitor system performance:
* Track system metrics and logs

--> Identify areas for improvement
= Gather user feedback:
* Collect feedback from users


--> Prioritize and implement feature requests
= Update and refine the system:
* Regularly update the system with new features and bug fixes
* Refine the system to improve performance and efficiency

TASK 3

[[

Identify the Tables and Relationships:
* Customers: Contains customer information.
* Books: Contains book details.
* Orders: Links customers to their orders.
* OrderDetails: Provides details about which books are included in each order.

Determine what information is needed:
* Examples of queries might include:
* Retrieve all orders for a specific customer.
* Find the total sales for a specific book.
* List all books ordered by a customer

Write SQL Queries based on requirements:
* For each query requirement, construct an appropriate SQL statement using JOINs to link tables as necessary.

Test the Queries
* Execute the queries against the database to ensure they return the expected results. Check for errors and optimize if necessary.

Analyze Results
* Review the output to ensure it meets the initial requirements. Adjust the queries if the results are not as expected.

Document the Queries
* Keep a record of the queries and their purposes for future reference or for other team members.
